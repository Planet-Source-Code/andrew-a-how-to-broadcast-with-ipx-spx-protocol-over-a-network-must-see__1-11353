</div>

### Description

Ever wanted to send some data to EVERY computer plugged into your LAN? Well, broadcasting is the way! This is an internet/chat programmers MUST HAVE! Also a game programmers must have! Here is just SOME of the possibilities of broadcasting: Create a SERVERLESS chat program, List all 'Tic-Tac-Toe' games playing on your lan, and join one!, Instant Messanger!, the list just keeps getting better! All I ask in return in sending you all coders this great code, is a vote :) - Thanx alot! If you need help on ANYTHING, e-mail me or ICQ me! (You can find my contact info in the program). There is also a EXE included, incase you just wanna try it out right now!
 
### More Info
 
Need a LAN, will not work accross internet. You can still just test it on your computer if you want to prove it works!
